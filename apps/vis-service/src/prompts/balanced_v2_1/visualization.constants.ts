// VISUALIZATION PROMPTS - BALANCED V2.1
// ============================================
// balanced_v2_1 builds on balanced_v2.
// balanced_v2 fixed: structural drift, lighting realism, renovation continuity.
// balanced_v2_1 fixes: arbitrary object placement, filler decor, unsupported elements.
//
// Differences from balanced_v2:
// - FURNISHING_STRATEGY: two additional lines enforcing functional use of space
// - OBJECT_PLACEMENT_LOGIC: new block inserted after FURNISHING_STRATEGY
// - STYLE_PRIORITY: one additional line redirecting style expression away from excess decor
//
// Everything else is identical to balanced_v2.

// Reuse influence / furniture / default helpers from improved

**PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURAL ANCHORING**

The following elements are FIXED and must not change:
- Wall planes, floor plane, and ceiling plane
- Window and door frames, their exact positions and sizes
- Camera angle, focal length, and perspective vanishing points
- Room spatial proportions and overall depth

Treat the input image as a real room undergoing renovation — not an empty architectural shell.
- Modify, replace, or upgrade surface finishes, furniture, and decor as needed for the selected style.
- Preserve the underlying spatial logic, layout, lighting behavior, and realism of the original room.
- The result should feel like a before-and-after renovation of the same physical space, not a rebuilt scene.

// --------------------------------------------
// RENOVATION CONTINUITY
// Identical to balanced_v2.
// --------------------------------------------
export const RENOVATION_CONTINUITY = `
**RENOVATION CONTINUITY:**
- The output must feel like a real renovation of the input room, not a reimagined or rebuilt scene.
- Maintain plausible furniture placement relative to walls, windows, circulation paths, and focal points.
- Avoid dramatic re-layouts that ignore the original spatial logic.
- The result should feel like a before-and-after transformation of the same room.

// --------------------------------------------
// FURNISHING STRATEGY
// Updated in balanced_v2_1: two additional lines enforcing functional use of space.
// --------------------------------------------
export const FURNISHING_STRATEGY = `
**FURNISHING STRATEGY:**
- Furnish the room in a complete but realistic way for the selected room type and style.
- You may reuse, adapt, or replace furniture as needed to match the target style.
- If the source room is empty, introduce a plausible furniture layout appropriate for the style.
- Do not leave the room empty unless explicitly requested.
- Do not over-stage the room beyond what is realistic for a lived-in, professionally designed interior.
- Furnishing must reflect realistic use of the space (sleeping, storage, circulation).
- Avoid unnecessary or decorative-only objects that do not support the room's function.

// --------------------------------------------
// OBJECT PLACEMENT LOGIC (new in balanced_v2_1)
// Inserted immediately after FURNISHING STRATEGY in Phase 2 assembly.
// Targets arbitrary mirrors, chairs, and filler decor with no spatial justification.
// --------------------------------------------
export const OBJECT_PLACEMENT_LOGIC = `
**OBJECT PLACEMENT LOGIC:**
- Every furniture or decor item must have a clear functional or spatial justification.
- Do NOT place objects solely to fill empty wall space or balance composition.
- Avoid isolated or unsupported items (e.g., standalone mirrors, chairs, or decor with no relationship to nearby furniture).
- Vertical elements (mirrors, art, shelving) must be anchored to a logical surface:
  - above a dresser or console
  - aligned with a bed or seating area
  - integrated into a cohesive wall composition
- Floor objects must respect circulation and not block natural movement paths.
- If a placement feels arbitrary or unsupported, omit the object instead of forcing it into the scene.
- Prefer omission over arbitrary placement.

// STYLE PRIORITY

export const STYLE_PRIORITY = `
**STYLE PRIORITY:**
- Ensure the design clearly reflects the defining characteristics of the selected style.
- Use the provided materials, colors, and finishes to create a distinctive and recognizable aesthetic.
- Avoid overly neutral or generic interpretations.
- Style must be expressed through materials, color palette, and furniture selection — not through excessive decor or arbitrary object placement.

// REALISM CONSTRAINT
// Identical to balanced_v2.
// --------------------------------------------
export const REALISM_CONSTRAINT = `
**REALISM CONSTRAINT:**
- The room must feel like a real, livable residential interior, not a conceptual render or cinematic scene.
- Avoid dark, moody, or theatrically dim lighting. Warm, well-lit residential lighting is preferred and does not count as dramatic.
- Materials, lighting, and furniture should feel natural, vibrant, and appropriate for everyday living.
- The result should resemble a professionally staged home renovation visualization, not a stylized design showcase.

**DESIGN RULES:**

1. **Architectural Priority:**
   - Furniture adapts to the room — not the reverse.
   - Do not alter walls, windows, doors, or architectural openings to fit furniture.
   - Apply all materials as surface treatments, not structural additions.
   - Do not introduce new walls, partitions, or dividers.

2. **Material Zoning:**
   - Apply materials selectively and realistically.
   - Balance dominant materials with quieter secondary surfaces — do not repeat one material on every surface.

3. **Lighting:**
   - Maintain the light directionality and spatial character of the original image.
   - Preserve material readability — surfaces should remain clearly visible and color-accurate.
   - Shadows should be soft and realistic, consistent with the original image's ambient conditions.

**RENOVATION FEASIBILITY RULES:**
- Apply materials in ways consistent with real-world construction.
- Do not apply heavy materials (such as stone or brick) to thin, detailed, or ornamental architectural features.
- Large-scale materials must respect existing wall planes and proportions.
- If a material conflicts with geometry, adapt the material — do not distort the structure.

**LIGHTING PRESERVATION AND NORMALIZATION:**
- Preserve the brightness level of the original image.
- Do not make the scene darker than the input unless explicitly requested.
- Maintain the same daylight direction and realistic daylight intensity.
- Use bright, natural, residential lighting with warm-to-neutral white color temperature.
- Avoid cinematic lighting, heavy contrast, moody shadows, and overcast gray tones.
- Materials must remain well-lit, color-accurate, and visually readable.
- The final image should feel like it was photographed in natural daylight, not dramatically lit for mood.
