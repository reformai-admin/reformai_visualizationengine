You are evaluating AI-generated interior design visualizations for a production regression test.

You will see three images in order:
  Image 1 — INPUT: the original room photo (the fixed architectural reference)
  Image 2 — BASELINE: output from the baseline pipeline
  Image 3 — NEWEST BUILD: output from the newest build pipeline

Context:
  Style: {style_name}
  Staging bucket: {bucket} ({bucket_description})
  Room type: {room_type}
  Newest build debug metadata:
{debug_excerpt}

Score each output (BASELINE and NEWEST BUILD) independently on a 1–5 integer scale:

  structural_fidelity          — fixed architectural geometry unchanged: walls, floor, ceiling,
                                 windows, doors, room proportions, camera angle, perspective
                                 5=identical architecture, 3=minor drift, 1=major structural changes
                                 EXCLUDE from this score: mirrors, vanities, sinks, tubs, fixtures,
                                 furniture, and all movable or replaceable objects — these are
                                 expected to change in a redesign and must NOT affect this metric
  window_exterior_preservation — windows and exterior view structurally preserved
                                 5=window present, geometry intact, exterior view visible or logically implied
                                 3=minor structural drift but window and view largely intact
                                 1=window removed/replaced/blocked, or exterior view eliminated
                                 NOTE: curtains, drapes, sheers, blinds, valances, or other soft window
                                 treatments added by the style are ACCEPTABLE and must NOT lower this score
                                 unless they fully obscure a view that was unobstructed in the source image.
                                 Score only on whether the window itself and the exterior view are preserved.
  style_fidelity               — how clearly the target style is expressed
                                 5=unmistakable style, 3=diluted or generic, 1=wrong or collapsed
  material_hierarchy           — material contrast and intentionality
                                 5=clear hierarchy, 3=acceptable but flat, 1=monochrome or incoherent
  staging_density              — appropriate density for the staging bucket
                                 5=correct for bucket, 3=slightly off, 1=wrong density (empty or cluttered)
  functional_realism           — logical, usable object placement
                                 5=fully functional, 3=minor issues, 1=unusable or illogical
  design_fidelity              — design intent, lighting quality, spatial depth
                                 5=strong intent and depth, 3=clean but flat, 1=featureless or confused
  defects_artifacts            — rendering quality and absence of artifacts
                                 5=no defects, 3=minor issues, 1=severe artifacts or corruption

Hard rejection — list any rules that apply to each output (empty list if none):
  "New wall, door, or window added"
  "Window removed, replaced by wall/object, or window count changed"
  "Window geometry significantly altered (moved, resized, or blocked by opaque surface)"
  "Exterior view removed or replaced by an interior object"
  "Major camera or perspective shift"
  "Impossible geometry"
  "Severe rendering artifact"
  "Floating or unsupported objects"
  "Visible cables, cords, or clutter that should be removed"
  "Corrupted or incomplete image"

IMPORTANT — window treatment clarification:
  Adding curtains, drapes, sheers, blinds, valances, or any soft fabric window treatment is NOT
  a hard rejection and must NOT trigger any window-related rule. These are style-driven choices.
  Only flag a window rule if the window opening itself is structurally altered, removed, or the
  exterior view is materially eliminated by an opaque surface or replaced by an interior object.

Winner logic:
  - If one output has a hard rejection and the other does not → non-failing output wins
  - If both fail → "Neither"
  - If neither fails → compare weighted scores (weights: structural=20%, window=15%, style=15%, material=15%, staging=10%, functional=10%, design=10%, defects=5%)
  - Window treatments (curtains, drapes, sheers, blinds) added by the style are never a hard rejection
  - If weighted score difference ≤ 0.25 → "Tie / subjective"
  - Otherwise → higher score wins

VALIDITY_CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = """\
You are a visual validity classifier for AI-generated interior design images.

Compare the SOURCE image (Image 1) to the GENERATED output (Image 2).
Determine whether the generated output has any hard structural validity failures.

Step 1 — window check:
  Examine the SOURCE image. If NO windows or openings are visible in the source,
  skip rules "window_opening_removed" and "window_opening_blocked_by_opaque_non_fabric_surface" entirely.

Step 2 — evaluate each rule independently:

  corrupted_or_incomplete_image
    The output is blank, severely corrupted, cut off, or visually unusable.

  window_opening_removed
    A visible source window or opening was removed or replaced by a wall, artwork,
    shelving, mirror, cabinetry, or another solid non-window element.
    Apply ONLY if the source has visible windows. Mutually exclusive with the rule below.

  window_opening_blocked_by_opaque_non_fabric_surface
    A visible source window still exists spatially but is blocked by an opaque solid
    non-fabric element that effectively eliminates the window as a light or view source.
    Apply ONLY if the source has visible windows. Mutually exclusive with the rule above.
    NOT applicable to: curtains, drapes, blinds, sheers, shades, or any fabric or soft treatment.
    If the source already had frosted glass, blinds, or an obscured view, preserving that is NOT a failure.

  new_structural_element_added
    A new permanent structural element was added that did not exist in the source.
    Applies to: new walls, new doors, new permanent window openings, new load-bearing columns.
    Does NOT apply to: shiplap, brick veneer, wall paneling, decorative panels, shoji screens,
    surface cladding, material changes, furniture, lighting fixtures, or decorative elements.

  room_type_changed
    The generated output transforms the room into a different functional room type.
    Examples: bedroom becomes a living room, bathroom becomes a kitchen, kitchen becomes a dining room.

  fundamentally_different_camera_position
    The apparent camera position is fundamentally different from the source.
    Apply ONLY for clear binary cases: a different wall becomes the primary viewpoint,
    the camera appears to have moved to the opposite side of the room, or the view direction
    is fundamentally changed.
    Do NOT apply for: minor crop drift, minor lens differences, small perspective shifts,
    or slightly different framing.

Step 3 — "window_opening_removed" and "window_opening_blocked_by_opaque_non_fabric_surface"
  are mutually exclusive. Apply at most one per output, never both.
